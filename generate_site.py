    "about_me": "I am a PhD Candidate in Finance at Finland's Graduate School of Finance (GSF), the national doctoral program whose recent graduates hold positions at London Business School, Imperial College London, Ohio State University, and Erasmus Rotterdam. I am affiliated with Hanken School of Economics and currently a visiting scholar at the UNC Kenan-Flagler Business School (Jan 2025 – Dec 2026), working under Professor Camelia M. Kuhnen. I am also an active member of the Nordic Finance Network (NFN), spanning 14 institutions across four Nordic countries. My research applies machine learning and large-scale data analysis to questions in Household Finance, Behavioral Finance, and Urban Economics. Before academia, I spent over a decade as an entrepreneur and in data-intensive industry roles—founding multiple tech startups where I raised over €3M from investors and successfully exited two ventures, building production ML systems as a Data Scientist at Silicon Labs (NASDAQ-listed), and developing systematic trading strategies at Estlander & Partners hedge fund. This blend of rigorous quantitative training and entrepreneurial and technical experience shapes my approach to data-driven research in finance.",

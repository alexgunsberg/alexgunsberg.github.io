My research focuses on Household Finance, Behavioral Finance, and Urban Economics, with clear influences from my machine learning background.\nOver the past decade, I co-founded and worked with startups, which helped me develop a mindset of getting things done, resilience, and a good understanding of people and what drives them. Additionally, my roles as a Senior Sales Manager at a CTA hedge fund and as a Data Scientist at a Nasdaq-listed semiconductor company provided me with experience in financial strategy, market analysis, and programming skills in Python, as well as basic skills in R and SQL."

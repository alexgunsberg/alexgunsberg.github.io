## About

I am a PhD Candidate in Finance at GSF—The Graduate School of Finance, affiliated with Hanken School of Economics. My research focuses on Household Finance, Behavioral Finance, and Urban Economics, with clear influences from my machine learning background.

Over the past decade, I co-founded and worked with startups, which helped me develop a mindset of getting things done, resilience, and a good understanding of people and what drives them. Additionally, my roles as a Senior Sales Manager at a CTA hedge fund and as a Data Scientist at a Nasdaq-listed semiconductor company provided me with experience in financial strategy, market analysis, and programming skills in Python, as well as basic skills in R and SQL.

## Personal life

Characterized by a relentless drive, hard work ethic, and a penchant for innovation, I
bring a unique blend of experience and skills to my academic pursuits. Before pursuing
my PhD, I honed my analytical abilities as a Data Scientist, became proficient in Python,
and gained entrepreneurial experience.

Outside academia, I’m family-centric and maintain a balanced lifestyle, enjoying
activities like CrossFit and endurance sports. I am preparing for my first Ultra-cycling
race this summer and have competed in a few ultra-trail running races.

## Personal life

Characterized by a relentless drive, hard work ethic, and a penchant for innovation, I
bring a unique blend of experience and skills to my academic pursuits. Before pursuing
my PhD, I honed my analytical abilities as a Data Scientist, became proficient in Python,
and gained entrepreneurial experience.

Outside academia, I’m family-centric and maintain a balanced lifestyle, enjoying
activities like CrossFit and endurance sports. I am preparing for my first Ultra-cycling
race this summer and have competed in a few ultra-trail running races.
